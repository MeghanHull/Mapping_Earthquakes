# Mapping Earthquakes
<!-- Interactive Earthquake Map from GeoJSON, using JavaScript, D3 &amp; Leaflet libraries, and Mapbox API (Rice Bootcamp) -->
## Project Background
Role: Data Visualization Specialist for Disaster Reporting Network

Basil requests interactive map of earthquakes (source: earthquake GeoJSON from USGS)
- Illustrate magnitude and location of earthquakes with popup markers
  - Magnitude denoted with increased marker diameter and darher color
  - Legend included on map
- Include fault lines on map

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

# Project Plan
## Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.
